# SOC-2024--Finite-element-analysis
I have attached a link below to the video lectures that were given to us as study material in the form of a Finite Element Analysis course uploaded online. The course helped me build a thorough understanding of what FEA is and what goes into the backend of a FEA solver, the equations, parameters, conditions, etc. involved for the simulation of real world physical problems using FEA. This will help us program various solvers based on Finite element Method catering to different applications. So it was more of a research project where we understood how to make a solver.

Next we were given assignments to get a better grasp of things.
Finally the project contains codes for a problem statament given to us related to trusses where we conduct the FEA for the structure to find relevant quantities.
The project alos includes a mini project for the FEA of a robotic arm but I am still in the process of doing it and I wish to continue the project going ahead.
